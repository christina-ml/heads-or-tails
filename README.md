# Heads or Tails

It's a coin flip web app!

This is a personal project to practice using forms and event listeners, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Style

- All elements are centered on the page
- Has a header
- Default image to start for coin
- Has a "Flip!" button

## Functionality

- The header tells you this is a Coin Flip
- A form that contains the coin, and one side
- An input submit button for the form to "Flip!" the coin.
- Once the submit button is clicked, the Event Listener will "flip" the coin, and either Heads or Tails will appear on the coin.
